My idea was assinging letters a prime number and calculating their hash by multiplying them.

Ideally there should be no overlap, as different combinations of letters shouldn't get the same hash because of mathematical property of prime numbers to not be a product of any other numbers.

Java was my first choice but yielded a slow speed.

This C implementation has a promising execution time but I couldn't make it before the deadline for my poor skills in the language.
